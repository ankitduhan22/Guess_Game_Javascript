PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

GUESS GAME

This project is based on HTML, CSS and javascript in which user will guess one secret number from 1 to 20 and based on user's input game will give output based on the number.

If user has guessed it correctly then UI will display that you have won the game otherwise it will display number too low or too high based on the the secret number.

I have added event handling on button click in this project.
